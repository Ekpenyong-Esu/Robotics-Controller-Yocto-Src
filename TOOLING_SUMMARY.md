# Robotics Controller Tooling Summary

## Overview

The `scripts/` directory now contains comprehensive tooling for managing the Yocto-based Robotics Controller project. All scripts follow best practices for Yocto development and avoid problematic patterns like symbolic links in recipe files.

## Enhanced Scripts

### 1. `manage-recipe.sh` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Manages meta-robotics layer recipes and source synchronization

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Synchronizes source code from `src/` to recipe files (uses file copies, not symlinks)
- ✅ Validates meta-layer structure and dependencies
- ✅ Checks for symbolic links and provides recommendations
- ✅ Updates recipe checksums and version information
- ✅ Cleans recipe-specific build artifacts
- ✅ Tests recipe builds in isolation

**Commands**:
```bash
./scripts/manage-recipe.sh sync-src         # Sync source to recipe
./scripts/manage-recipe.sh validate         # Validate meta-layer
./scripts/manage-recipe.sh show-info        # Show recipe info
./scripts/manage-recipe.sh check-symlinks   # Check for symlinks
./scripts/manage-recipe.sh test-recipe      # Test recipe build
./scripts/manage-recipe.sh clean-recipe     # Clean recipe files
```

### 2. `build.sh` (ENHANCED)
**Purpose**: Sets up Yocto environment and builds the system

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Automatically calls `manage-recipe.sh sync-src` before building
- ✅ Validates meta-robotics layer structure
- ✅ Ensures source code is synchronized with recipe

### 3. `clean.sh` (ENHANCED)
**Purpose**: Cleans build artifacts and temporary files

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Automatically calls `manage-recipe.sh clean-recipe`
- ✅ Cleans meta-robotics specific files
- ✅ Removes recipe backup files and temporary files

### 4. `flash.sh` (ENHANCED)
**Purpose**: Flashes Yocto image to SD card

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Checks if source is newer than recipe before flashing
- ✅ Offers to sync source to recipe if needed
- ✅ Ensures latest source code is included in the image

## Best Practices Implemented

### ✅ No Symbolic Links in Recipes
- Recipe files use actual file copies, not symbolic links
- Better build reproducibility across different environments
- Avoids cross-compilation and packaging issues
- Compatible with BitBake expectations

### ✅ Source Synchronization
- Source code is copied from `src/` to `meta-robotics/recipes-robotics/robotics-controller/files/src/`
- Timestamp checking to detect when sync is needed
- Automatic sync integration in build and flash workflows

### ✅ Validation and Error Checking
- Validates meta-layer structure
- Checks for required files and directories
- Detects symbolic links and provides recommendations
- Error handling with proper exit codes

### ✅ Integration Between Scripts
- `build.sh` automatically syncs source before building
- `clean.sh` cleans recipe-specific files
- `flash.sh` checks sync status before flashing
- All scripts work together seamlessly

## Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow:
1. **Edit source code** in `src/robotics-controller/` or `src/web-interface/`
2. **Sync to recipe**: `./scripts/manage-recipe.sh sync-src`
3. **Build system**: `./scripts/build.sh`
4. **Flash to hardware**: `./scripts/flash.sh /dev/sdX`

### Alternative (Automatic):
1. **Edit source code** in `src/`
2. **Build system**: `./scripts/build.sh` (automatically syncs)
3. **Flash to hardware**: `./scripts/flash.sh /dev/sdX` (checks sync status)
